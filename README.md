# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice code for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The aim is to regularly update this repository with solutions to various DSA problems that I work on.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Arrays**
  - Problems and solutions related to arrays.
- **Linked Lists**
  - Implementation and problem solutions for various types of linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**
  - Stack and queue related problems and solutions.
- **Trees**
  - Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs**
  - Solutions to graph-related problems, including BFS, DFS, etc.
- **Sorting and Searching**
  - Different sorting algorithms and searching techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Problems solved using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Miscellaneous**
  - Other DSA problems that don't fit into the above categories.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohansaini1512/DSA.git
